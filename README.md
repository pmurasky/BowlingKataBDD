Bowling Game BDD
==================

Pete created the original repo as an exercise of a Randori.
The idea was to show people the difference between BDD and TDD.
I joined the Randori in session two and objected to some of the choices the group had made.
I didn't like the feel of the Frame class or the externaization of FrameScorer and
a lot of other things. 

I forked the repo and reset the start point of the exercise. I then went about implementing
from scratch. There was still some influence on my design from the tests, but a lot less
than before. I then messed around with lots of options and wandered about in my design.

The exercise was good fun. I was also fun to forget Uncle Bob's implemetnation and sort of
do my own thing. 

The last bit, with the validations, I put in because I know the group and they will 
complain if I don't validate my inputs. Fair enough, I think I've done that.
